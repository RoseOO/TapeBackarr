## Tape Handling Procedures

### Inserting a Tape

1. **Verify the tape** matches what the system expects
2. **Check for damage** - no visible damage to cartridge
3. **Insert gently** - don't force the tape
4. **Wait for ready** - LED should indicate ready state
5. **Acknowledge** in the web interface if prompted

### Removing a Tape

1. **Wait for operations to complete** - never remove during writes
2. **Use the Eject function** in the web UI or on the drive
3. **Wait for full ejection** before removing
4. **Label the tape** with any notes if needed
5. **Store properly** in case or appropriate storage

### Labeling Best Practices

**Physical Label (on cartridge):**
```
WEEKLY-001
Pool: WEEKLY
Created: 2024-01-15
```

**In TapeBackarr:**
- Use consistent naming: `POOL-NUMBER` (e.g., WEEKLY-001)
- Add notes for special circumstances
- Export tape when moving offsite

## Handling Tape Changes

### When Tape Change is Requested

You'll receive notification via:
1. **Web Dashboard** - Alert banner appears
2. **Telegram** (if configured) - Push notification

### Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Read the notification carefully**
   - Note which tape to remove
   - Note which tape to insert

2. **Go to the tape drive**
   - Verify the drive LED shows safe to remove
   - Press the physical eject button OR use web UI

3. **Remove the current tape**
   - Wait for full ejection
   - Store the tape properly

4. **Get the requested tape**
   - If new tape: get a blank from storage
   - If specific tape: locate in tape library

5. **Insert the new tape**
   - Verify it's the correct tape
   - Insert gently until it seats

6. **Acknowledge in Web UI**
   - Go to Dashboard or current job status
   - Click "Tape Changed" or "Acknowledge"

7. **Wait for operation to resume**
   - Monitor status to ensure success

### Tape Change Timeout

If a tape change is not acknowledged within **30 minutes**:
- The operation will be paused
- Additional notifications will be sent
- Job can be resumed once tape is inserted

## Multi-Tape Backup Spanning

### Understanding Spanning

When a backup is larger than one tape, it automatically spans:

```
Backup Job: Full-FileServer (500GB)

Tape 1: WEEKLY-001 [||||||||||||||||||||] 400GB ✓
         ↓ (spanning marker)
Tape 2: WEEKLY-002 [||||||||           ] 100GB ✓

Backup Complete!
```

### Spanning Sequence

1. Backup starts on first tape
2. When tape fills, system pauses
3. Notification sent for tape change
4. Operator inserts new tape
5. Operator acknowledges in web UI
6. Backup continues on new tape
7. Process repeats until backup completes

### Tracking Spanning Sets

Each spanning set is tracked with:
- **Set ID**: Links all tapes together
- **Sequence**: 1, 2, 3... order of tapes
- **Markers**: Written on each tape for recovery

## Restoring from Tape

### Simple Single-File Restore

### Multi-File Restore

1. Search and select multiple files

3. Note the insertion order
4. Click **Start Restore**
5. Insert tapes in order as prompted
6. Acknowledge each tape change

### Multi-Tape Spanning Restore

When restoring from a spanning set:

```
Required Tapes (in order):
1. WEEKLY-001 (insert first)
2. WEEKLY-002 (will prompt when needed)
3. WEEKLY-003 (will prompt when needed)
```

**Procedure:**
1. Insert first tape in the sequence
