## Configuring Backup Sources

### Supported Source Types

| Type | Path Example | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Local | `/data/backups` | Direct filesystem path |
| NFS | `/mnt/nfs/share` | Mount NFS share first |
| SMB/CIFS | `/mnt/smb/share` | Mount SMB share first |

### Adding a Source

1. Navigate to **Sources**
2. Click **Add Source**
3. Configure:
   - **Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "FileServer-Home")
   - **Type**: Select local, nfs, or smb
   - **Path**: Full path to the mounted directory
   - **Include Patterns**: Files to include (glob patterns)
   - **Exclude Patterns**: Files to exclude (glob patterns)

### Pattern Examples

**Include Patterns:**
```
*.doc
*.pdf
*.xlsx
important/*
```

**Exclude Patterns:**
```
*.tmp
*.log
cache/*
.git/*
node_modules/*
```

### Pre-mounting Network Shares

Before using NFS or SMB sources, mount them on the system:

```bash
# NFS mount
sudo mount -t nfs fileserver:/export/data /mnt/nfs/data

# SMB mount
sudo mount -t cifs //server/share /mnt/smb/share -o username=user,password=pass

# Add to /etc/fstab for persistent mounts
```

## Creating and Running Backup Jobs

### Creating a Backup Job

1. Navigate to **Jobs**
2. Click **Create Job**
3. Configure:
   - **Name**: Job name (e.g., "Daily-FileServer")
   - **Source**: Select the backup source
   - **Pool**: Target tape pool
   - **Backup Type**: Full or Incremental
   - **Schedule**: Cron expression (or leave empty for manual)

### Schedule Examples (Cron Format)

| Expression | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `0 2 * * *` | Daily at 2:00 AM |
| `0 3 * * 0` | Weekly on Sunday at 3:00 AM |
| `0 4 1 * *` | Monthly on the 1st at 4:00 AM |
| `0 */6 * * *` | Every 6 hours |

### Backup Types

**Full Backup:**
- Backs up all files matching the include/exclude patterns
- Creates a complete snapshot
- Use for initial backups and periodic full copies

**Incremental Backup:**
- Only backs up files changed since the last backup
- Compares modification time and file size
- Faster and uses less tape space

### Running a Backup Manually

1. Navigate to **Jobs**
2. Find the job you want to run
3. Click **Run Now**
4. Monitor progress on the Dashboard

---

## Multi-Tape Spanning

TapeBackarr automatically handles backups that span multiple tapes.

### How Spanning Works

1. When a tape becomes full during a backup:
   - The current tape is marked as full
   - A **tape change notification** is sent (if configured)
   - The backup pauses and waits for a new tape

2. The operator:
   - Receives notification via Telegram (if configured)
   - Ejects the current tape
   - Inserts a new tape
   - Acknowledges the change in the web interface

3. The backup continues:
   - The new tape is labeled
   - A continuation marker links the tapes
   - The backup resumes from where it stopped

### Spanning Markers

Each tape in a spanning set contains:
- **Set ID**: Unique identifier for the backup set
- **Sequence Number**: Position in the spanning sequence
- **Previous Tape**: Reference to the previous tape
- **Next Tape**: Reference to the next tape (updated when known)

### Tape Insertion Guidance

During restore, the system guides you through tape changes:

```
Restore requires 3 tapes in this order:
1. WEEKLY-001 (insert first)
2. WEEKLY-002 (continue)
3. WEEKLY-003 (final tape)

Please insert tape WEEKLY-001 and click Continue.
```

| **NFS** | Pre-mounted NFS share | `/mnt/nfs/restore` |

**Note:** For network destinations (SMB/NFS), mount the share first using standard Linux commands:

```bash
# Mount SMB share
sudo mount -t cifs //server/share /mnt/smb/restore -o username=user,password=pass

# Mount NFS share
sudo mount -t nfs server:/export/path /mnt/nfs/restore
```

2. **Rotate pools**: Use DAILY/WEEKLY/MONTHLY rotation
3. **Store offsite**: Regularly move tapes offsite
4. **Track inventory**: Update status when tapes move
5. **Retire old tapes**: Replace tapes after recommended lifetime

### Backup Strategy

1. **3-2-1 Rule**: 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite
2. **Test restores**: Regularly verify backups work
3. **Full + Incremental**: Monthly full, daily incremental
4. **Document sources**: Keep source configurations documented
5. **Backup the database**: Periodically backup TapeBackarr's database to tape

### Security

1. **Change default password** immediately
2. **Use strong passwords** for all accounts
3. **Limit admin access** to necessary users
4. **Review audit logs** regularly
5. **Secure the server** (firewall, updates)

### Monitoring

1. **Enable notifications**: Set up Telegram for alerts
2. **Check dashboard daily**: Look for warnings
3. **Monitor disk space**: Ensure database has space
4. **Review failed jobs**: Investigate and resolve issues

### Disaster Recovery

1. **Document recovery procedures** before you need them
2. **Keep a tape inventory** separate from the system
3. **Test full restores** periodically
4. **Have spare tapes** on hand
5. **Know your tape rotation** locations
6. **Backup the TapeBackarr database** to tape regularly

---

## Database Backup

TapeBackarr can backup its own database to tape for disaster recovery. This ensures you can recover your tape catalog and configuration even if the server is lost.

### Why Backup the Database?

The TapeBackarr database contains:
- File catalog with block offset information
- Tape inventory and pool assignments
- Backup job configurations
- User accounts
- Audit logs

Without this database, you would need to manually catalog each tape to know its contents.

### Backup Database to Tape

Via API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/database-backup/backup \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tape_id": 1}'
```

### Restore Database from Tape

Via API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/database-backup/restore \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"backup_id": 1, "dest_path": "/tmp/restore"}'
```

### Best Practices for Database Backup

1. **Schedule regular backups**: Weekly or after major changes
2. **Use archive tapes**: Store database backups on long-term archive tapes
3. **Test restoration**: Periodically verify database backups can be restored
4. **Document the process**: Keep written instructions for database recovery

## In-App Documentation

TapeBackarr includes comprehensive documentation accessible directly from the web interface.

### Accessing Documentation

1. Click **Documentation** (📖) in the sidebar
2. Select a document from the list
3. Read the content directly in the browser

### Available Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|

| Manual Recovery | Recover data without TapeBackarr |
| Architecture | System design and data flows |
| Database Schema | Database table definitions |

### Manual Recovery Guide

The **Manual Recovery** document is especially important for long-term archival. It contains step-by-step instructions for recovering data from tape using only standard Linux commands (mt, tar), without needing TapeBackarr.

This is useful when:
- The TapeBackarr server is unavailable
- Recovering data many years after archival
- Disaster recovery scenarios

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tape not detected:**
```bash
# Check device exists
ls -la /dev/st* /dev/nst*

# Check permissions
groups $(whoami)  # Should include 'tape'

# Manual status check
mt -f /dev/nst0 status
```

**Backup fails to start:**
1. Check source path is accessible
2. Verify tape is loaded
3. Check tape is not write-protected
4. Review logs for specific error

**Restore not finding files:**
1. Verify backup completed successfully
2. Search with different patterns
3. Check if file was excluded

**Telegram notifications not working:**
1. Verify bot token is correct
2. Check chat ID is correct (include `-` for groups)
3. Ensure bot is added to the chat
4. Test with: `curl https://api.telegram.org/bot{YOUR_TOKEN}/getMe`

For additional help, check the system logs at `/var/log/tapebackarr/`.
